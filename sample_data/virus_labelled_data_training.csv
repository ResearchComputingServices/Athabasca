BIO,"DNA nomenclature for viruses with genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-sense viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand."
BIO,"Others, such as the dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects."

BIO,"(i) genetic material, i.e., long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts;"
BIO,"Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle."
BIO,This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections.
BIO,"Viruses are also major agents responsible for the destruction of phytoplankton including harmful algal blooms, The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms."
BIO,"The smallest—the ssDNA circoviruses, family Circoviridae—code for only two proteins and have a genome size of only two kilobases; the largest—the pandoraviruses—have genome sizes of around two megabases which code for about 2500 proteins."
BIO,"Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope, which makes them vulnerable to soap and alcohol."

BIO,Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted.
BIO,"Often, infected people are isolated from the rest of the community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine."
BIO,Most of these viruses are bacteriophages infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanophages infecting cyanobacteria and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.
BIO,The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.
BIO,"In the early 1890s, Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this method to study what became known as the tobacco mosaic virus."
BIO,"The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection."
BIO,Protein filaments measuring 100 nm project from the surface.
BIO,They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication.
BIO,"During the 20th century there were four pandemics caused by influenza virus and those that occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968 were severe."
BIO,"These are solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as tungsten, that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain."
BIO,Replication of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins.
BIO,They differ from autonomous growth of crystals as they inherit genetic mutations while being subject to natural selection.
BIO,"Some viruses may have evolved from plasmids, which are pieces of DNA that can move between cells."
BIO,"These techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA, but most viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old."
BIO,The mechanism of recombination used by coronaviruses likely involves template switching by the polymerase during genome replication.
BIO,This is called RNA interference.
BIO,"In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria and more than a thousand bacteriophage viruses would fit inside an Escherichia coli bacterium's cell."
BIO,One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself.
BIO,The capsid is made from proteins encoded by the viral genome and its shape serves as the basis for morphological distinction.

BIO,"Animals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses."
BIO,The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus and inovirus are examples of helical viruses.
BIO,"Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material."
BIO,Rosalind Franklin developed X-ray crystallographic pictures and determined the full structure of TMV in 1955.
BIO,"Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 nanometres; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to 1 centimetre (0.4 in)."
BIO,"Horizontal transmission can occur when body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, by exchange of saliva or when contaminated food or water is ingested."
BIO,Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface.
BIO,"Most of these point mutations are ""silent""—they do not change the protein that the gene encodes—but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs."
BIO,Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze.
BIO,There are three major theories about the origins of viruses:
BIO,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments; one teaspoon of seawater contains about ten million viruses, and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems."
BIO,"At around 1000 nanometres, these viruses, which infect amoebae, were discovered in 2003 and 2013."
BIO,"When a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus such that the cell cannot repair itself, this often triggers apoptosis."
BIO,"It is, therefore, a defective virus."
BIO,Many viruses that have been studied are spherical and have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres.
BIO,"There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, made out of proteins."
BIO,"These latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis."
BIO,The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.
BIO,"In general, there are five main morphological virus types."
BIO,"Viruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and are too small to be seen by light microscopy; most of them can only be seen by electron microscopy."
BIO,Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus.
BIO,Genome size varies greatly between species.
BIO,Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.
BIO,"Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease."
BIO,"To prevent infections and epidemics, it is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread."
BIO,"When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus."
BIO,"The bacteria Rickettsia and Chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells."
BIO,Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry.
BIO,"Also, viruses are recognised as ancient, and to have origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains."
BIO,"When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics."
BIO,"Influenza virus, for example, changes often, so a new vaccine is needed each year."
BIO,"Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry."
BIO,Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases.
BIO,"Assembly – Following the structure-mediated self-assembly of the virus particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs."
BIO,"The breakthrough came in 1931, when American pathologists Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza, and several other viruses, in fertilised chickens' eggs."
BIO,"Thought to have originated in bats and subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, infections with the virus cause a disease called COVID-19, that varies in severity from mild to deadly, and led to a pandemic in 2020."
BIO,"When virions are coated with stain (positive staining), fine detail is obscured."
BIO,"A virus has either a DNA or an RNA genome and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively."
BIO,These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells.
BIO,This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.
BIO,"There are millions of different types of viruses, although fewer than 7,000 types have been described in detail."
BIO,This prevents DNA replication because the drugs lack the essential features that allow the formation of a DNA chain.
BIO,Horizontal transmission is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations.
BIO,"When all other microbial food sources were removed from the water, the ciliate Halteria was observed to have increased in number due to the active consumption of chlorovirus as a food source instead of its typical bacterivore diet."
BIO,Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell.
BIO,"A related coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and spread rapidly around the world."
BIO,"Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres."

BIO,Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea.
BIO,"By contrast colds, influenza and rotavirus infections are usually a problem during the winter months."
BIO,Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses.
BIO,RNA viruses often exist as quasispecies or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences.
BIO,When DNA production stops the virus can no longer reproduce.
BIO,"This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule—a chemokine receptor—which is most commonly found on the surface of CD4+ T-Cells."
BIO,These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria.
BIO,This can be a result of recombination or reassortment.
BIO,"Throughout history, human migration has aided the spread of pandemic infections; first by sea and in modern times also by air."
BIO,"It seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms."
BIO,"In comparison, bacteria are typically around 1000 nanometres (1 micrometer) in diameter, and host cells of higher organisms are typically a few tens of micrometers."
BIO,Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type.
BIO,"The whole virion is slightly pleomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick-shaped."
BIO,"Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall."
BIO,They serve as important reservoirs of the virus.
BIO,"In countries with a temperate climate, viral diseases are usually seasonal."
BIO,Some viruses of humans and other animals are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids.
BIO,"Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in children and adults, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby."
BIO,"Over 4,800 species of viruses have been described in detail out of the millions in the environment."
BIO,The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes.
BIO,Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.
BIO,HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood.
BIO,"Some examples of such 'zoonotic' diseases include coronavirus in bats, and influenza in pigs and birds, before those viruses were transferred to humans."
BIO,"Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, more than 11,000 of the millions of virus species have been described in detail."
BIO,"Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA)."
BIO,"When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body."
BIO,"Viruses can also serve as an alternative food source for microorganisms which engage in virovory, supplying nucleic acids, nitrogen, and phosphorus through their consumption."
BIO,The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome.
BIO,"In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell."
BIO,"Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life."
BIO,"Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water."
BIO,"Viruses display a wide diversity of sizes and shapes, called 'morphologies'."
BIO,"Many viruses spread in the air by coughing and sneezing, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, chickenpox, smallpox, and measles."
BIO,"A viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds)."
BIO,Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed.
BIO,"Viruses can have a lipid ""envelope"" derived from the host cell membrane."
BIO,This process appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage.
BIO,This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.
BIO,These are formed from protein subunits called capsomeres.
BIO,This is also called the 'virus-first hypothesis' and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same time that cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years.
BIO,The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers or they may be composed of different proteins.
BIO,This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections.
BIO,"Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections, where the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms."
BIO,"In December 2022, scientists reported the first observation of virovory via an experiment on pond water containing chlorovirus, which commonly infects green algae in freshwater environments."
BIO,"This may be followed, for complex viruses with larger genomes, by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis: 'late' gene expression is, in general, of structural or virion proteins."
BIO,Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria.
BIO,"This lends credence to this theory, as their dependence on being parasites may have led to the loss of the genes that once allowed them to live on their own."
BIO,"This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways."
BIO,Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.
BIO,They therefore cannot naturally reproduce outside a host cell—although some bacteria such as rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same limitation.
BIO,"Restrictions unprecedented in peacetime were placed on international travel, and curfews imposed in several major cities worldwide."
BIO,The regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way.
BIO,"As of January 2021, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 193,000 complete genome sequences, but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered."
BIO,"Their effects are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year."
BIO,HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become infectious.
BIO,"Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this."
BIO,Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle.
BIO,"In developing countries, viruses that cause respiratory and enteric infections are common throughout the year."
BIO,"For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes."
BIO,"They are mainly responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life."
BIO,The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface.
BIO,Attachment is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell.
BIO,"These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms and single-celled organisms have also been shown to be vectors."
BIO,"Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors."
BIO,This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host.
BIO,"Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope, so scanning and transmission electron microscopes are used to visualise them."
BIO,Those vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some infections.
BIO,Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell.
BIO,"Lymphocytes retain a ""memory"" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called antibodies."
BIO,Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called budding.
BIO,Viruses have an extensive range of structural and biochemical effects on the host cell.These are called cytopathic effects.
BIO,"In addition, viral genetic material occasionally integrates into the germline of the host organisms, by which they can be passed on vertically to the offspring of the host for many generations."
BIO,"They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell."
BIO,"Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots."
BIO,"This is also called the 'degeneracy hypothesis', or 'reduction hypothesis'."
BIO,"Other viruses, such as measles virus, caused outbreaks regularly every third year."
BIO,The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles.
BIO,"In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the immune system, which can provide lifetime immunity to the host for that virus."
BIO,"An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria."
BIO,Viruses spread in many ways.
BIO,This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied.
BIO,New groups of viruses might have repeatedly emerged at all stages of the evolution of life.
BIO,"Virally-coded protein subunits will self-assemble to form a capsid, in general requiring the presence of the virus genome."
BIO,Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell.
BIO,Virus genes rarely have introns and often are arranged in the genome so that they overlap.
BIO,"This innate immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a ""memory"" of the infection."
BIO,Marine mammals are also susceptible to viral infections.
BIO,A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals.
BIO,"(ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases"
BIO,People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers.
BIO,"In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated."
BIO,"Viral genomes are circular, as in the polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses."
BIO,"Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres."
BIO,"People chronically infected are known as carriers, as they serve as reservoirs of infectious virus."
BIO,"Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores."
BIO,Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily.
BIO,"Plant viruses are frequently spread from plant to plant by organisms called ""vectors""."
BIO,Penetration or viral entry follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion.
BIO,"This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks."
BIO,"In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells."
BIO,This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code.
BIO,Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children.
BIO,"The viral genome is then known as a 'provirus' or, in the case of bacteriophages a 'prophage'."
BIO,"Some filoviruses, which are filaments, have a total length of up to 1400 nm; their diameters are only about 80 nm."
BIO,This stops the infection from spreading.
BIO,Viruses carried by insects are a common cause of diseases in these settings.
BIO,"Since the mid-1980s, the development of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic."
BIO,"This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell."
BIO,Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells.
BIO,"In 1884, French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented the Chamberland filter (or Chamberland–Pasteur filter), that contains pores smaller than bacteria."
BIO,Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs.
BIO,"Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they assemble in the cell."
BIO,"The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils, so molecular techniques are used to infer how they arose."
BIO,The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.
BIO,"In 1899, Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck observed that the agent only multiplied when in dividing cells."
BIO,This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus.
BIO,"To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered."
BIO,This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell.
BIO,"Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations."
BIO,This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication.
BIO,"In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii."
BIO,"At the same time, several other scientists showed that, although these agents (later called viruses) were different from bacteria and about one hundred times smaller, they could still cause disease."
BIO,Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products.
BIO,"In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell."
BIO,"Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans."
BIO,"Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species."
BIO,"Their life cycle differs greatly between species, but there are six basic stages in their life cycle:"
BIO,They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950.
BIO,Antigenic shift occurs when there is a major change in the genome of the virus.
BIO,"Before its eradication, smallpox was a cause of pandemics for more than 3,000 years."
BIO,"The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms."
BIO,"One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects."
BIO,"A virus with this ""viral envelope"" uses it—along with specific receptors—to enter a new host cell."
BIO,"Given that bacterial cell walls are much thinner than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside."
BIO,"Although viral pandemics are rare events, HIV—which evolved from viruses found in monkeys and chimpanzees—has been pandemic since at least the 1980s."
BIO,"Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell."
BIO,"Accepted forms of life use cell division to reproduce, whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells."
BIO,The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are still unclear.
BIO,"Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability—a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal."
BIO,Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA.
BIO,Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.
BIO,"Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented."
BIO,"In particular, lysis of bacteria by viruses has been shown to enhance nitrogen cycling and stimulate phytoplankton growth."
BIO,Cells in which the virus is latent (inactive) show few signs of infection and often function normally.
BIO,"Over 4,800 species of viruses have been described in detail."
BIO,"Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein."
BIO,Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses (or offspring) that have unique characteristics.
BIO,"The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells."
BIO,"When this happens with influenza viruses, pandemics might result."
BIO,"When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that destroy viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen molecules."
BIO,This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end.
BIO,Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms.
BIO,"A special hormone called interferon is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cells and their close neighbours."
BIO,The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence.
BIO,"To compensate, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes—the genome is split into smaller molecules—thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome."
BIO,"Most are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals."
BIO,"The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but single-stranded DNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein."
BIO,"Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that ""escaped"" from the genes of a larger organism."
BIO,Specific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called lymphocytes play a central role.
BIO,Coronaviruses have a single-strand positive-sense RNA genome.
BIO,"Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus have been developed by a similar strategy, using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs."
BIO,"The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range: this is narrow for viruses specialized to infect only a few species, or broad for viruses capable of infecting many."
BIO,Viruses spread in many ways.
BIO,Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments.
BIO,This provides an invaluable source of information for paleovirologists to trace back ancient viruses that existed as far back as millions of years ago.
BIO,"The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical, or more complex."
BIO,"This problem was solved in 1949, when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells."
BIO,"Influenza virus, HIV (which causes AIDS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (which causes COVID-19) use this strategy."
BIO,One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes.
BIO,They have probably existed since living cells first evolved.
BIO,"These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called 'satellites' and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses."
BIO,"Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope."
BIO,"Major changes can cause pandemics, as in the 2009 swine influenza that spread to most countries."
BIO,"In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile."
BIO,"Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell."
BIO,Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus.
BIO,"In comparison, humans have 20,000–25,000."
BIO,"Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata."
BIO,"Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations."
BIO,"Their sizes range from 20 to 300 nanometres; it would take 30,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one centimetre (0.4 in)."
BIO,"Other archaeal viruses resemble the tailed bacteriophages, and can have multiple tail structures."
BIO,"Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding."
BIO,"Their origin remains unclear because they do not fossilize, so molecular techniques have been the best way to hypothesise about how they arose."
BIO,"Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated."
BIO,The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells.
BIO,"Their use has resulted in the eradication of smallpox and a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella."
BIO,A regular icosahedron is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical subunits.
BIO,Genetic recombination is a process by which a strand of DNA (or RNA) is broken and then joined to the end of a different DNA (or RNA) molecule.
BIO,Some nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification.
BIO,Viruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes.
BIO,"Once called jumping genes, transposons are examples of mobile genetic elements and could be the origin of some viruses."
BIO,"The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include population density, the number of susceptible individuals, (i.e., those not immune), the quality of healthcare and the weather."
BIO,"Although many are very specific about which host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method to copy itself."
BIO,"Viral populations do not grow through cell division, because they are acellular."
BIO,"To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons."
BIO,"In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction."
BIO,"Franklin confirmed that viral proteins formed a spiral hollow tube, wrapped by RNA, and also showed that viral RNA was a single strand, not a double helix like DNA."
BIO,Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects.
BIO,"Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, by hands and communal objects, and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are airborne."
BIO,"Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost."
BIO,Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle.
BIO,"Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections."
BIO,"HIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life cycle."
BIO,"With the exception of smallpox, most pandemics are caused by newly evolved viruses."

BIO,Some blood cells engulf and destroy other virus-infected cells.
BIO,"It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus."
BIO,"The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase."
BIO,"In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus."
BIO,Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat.
BIO,Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.
BIO,"Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be ""benign""."
BIO,"These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells."
BIO,"He could then pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter, and completely remove them."
BIO,"This arrangement results in virions which can be short and highly rigid rods, or long and very flexible filaments."
BIO,A virus is a tiny infectious agent that reproduces inside the cells of living hosts.
BIO,The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function.
BIO,"Like any organism, marine mammals are susceptible to viral infections."
BIO,"Most types of viruses are restricted to just one or two of these mechanisms and they are referred to as ""respiratory viruses"" or ""enteric viruses"" and so forth."
BIO,"If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics."
BIO,The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is fewer than 100 particles.
BIO,"In the early 20th century, English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered viruses that infect bacteria, and French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on agar, would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria."
BIO,"In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and found it to be mainly made from protein."

BIO,"All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses."
BIO,"Some of these enzymes, called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase, make new copies of DNA and RNA."
BIO,Some viruses undergo a lysogenic cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host's chromosome.
BIO,The evidence for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences give a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses.
BIO,"Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism."
BIO,"Some species of virus envelop themselves in a modified form of one of the cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as a nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope."
BIO,They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment.
BIO,Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.
BIO,"Zika and dengue viruses for example are transmitted by the female Aedes mosquitoes, which bite humans particularly during the mosquitoes' breeding season."
BIO,"There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning."
BIO,"Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water."
BIO,"In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects."
BIO,Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect.
BIO,There are three main hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses:
BIO,The viral genome is mostly silent within the host.
BIO,"Beyond this, errors when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive."
BIO,"There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans."
BIO,Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections.
BIO,The capsid and entire virus structure can be mechanically (physically) probed through atomic force microscopy.
BIO,"In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA."
BIO,"Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection."
BIO,"Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells."
BIO,"Mimivirus is one of the largest characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400 nm."
BIO,"Viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and DNA at the same time as cells first appeared on earth, and would have depended on cellular life for many millions of years."
BIO,"Eventually, the genes they no longer needed for a parasitic way of life were lost."
BIO,"During this process, the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane."
BIO,"Release – Viruses can be released from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: this is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses."
BIO,There are problems with all of these theories.
BIO,They have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents.
BIO,Proteins are essential to life.
BIO,"After the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, usually giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus."
BIO,Replication of the genome is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
BIO,"Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses."
BIO,"For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses."
BIO,"At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to the active virus, which may lyse the host cells."
BIO,"For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface."
BIO,Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms.
BIO,"Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell."
BIO,"When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective."
BIO,"In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the high fidelity of their replication enzymes."
BIO,"Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines."
BIO,"Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person."
BIO,"Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus."
BIO,These are called negative-sense RNA viruses.
BIO,Uncoating is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid.
BIO,"They have been described as 'organisms at the edge of life', since they resemble organisms in that they possess genes, evolve by natural selection, and reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly."
BIO,"The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology."
BIO,"In these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease."
BIO,Viruses vary in shape from the simple helical and icosahedral to more complex structures.
BIO,"But unlike simpler infectious agents like prions, they contain genes, which allow them to mutate and evolve."
BIO,"Uncoating happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid."
BIO,Replication of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome.
BIO,Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation.
BIO,"Replication involves the synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from 'early' genes (with exceptions for positive-sense RNA viruses), viral protein synthesis, possible assembly of viral proteins, then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression."
BIO,It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea.
BIO,"To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct."
BIO,Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.
BIO,Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains.
BIO,"The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded."
BIO,"When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses."
BIO,"If the proportion of carriers in a given population reaches a given threshold, a disease is said to be endemic."
BIO,The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells.
BIO,The more harmful viruses are described as virulent.
BIO,Such quasispecies are a prime target for natural selection.
BIO,Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century.
BIO,"In January 2018, scientists reported that 800 million viruses, mainly of marine origin, are deposited daily from the Earth's atmosphere onto every square meter of the planet's surface, as the result of a global atmospheric stream of viruses, circulating above the weather system but below the altitude of usual airline travel, distributing viruses around the planet."
BIO,This is often the case with herpes viruses.
BIO,These genes contain the encoded biological information of the virus and are built from either DNA or RNA.
BIO,The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids (pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells) or transposons (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell).
BIO,Assembly takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.
BIO,"They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and are one of the most important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments."
BIO,"Common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox and cold sores."
BIO,"There are many types of plant virus, but often they only cause a decrease in yield, and it is not economically viable to try to control them."
BIO,"Antibiotics, which work against bacteria, have no impact, but antiviral drugs can treat life-threatening infections."
BIO,"Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved."
BIO,"The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA."
BIO,"Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called lysis."
BIO,"Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter."
BIO,"Some viruses that infect Archaea have complex structures unrelated to any other form of virus, with a wide variety of unusual shapes, ranging from spindle-shaped structures to viruses that resemble hooked rods, teardrops or even bottles."
BIO,Vaccines are available to prevent over fourteen viral infections of humans and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals.
BIO,"Although they have genes, they do not have a cellular structure, which is often seen as the basic unit of life."
BIO,"There are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:"
BIO,"For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven."
BIO,Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.
BIO,Viroids are important pathogens of plants.
BIO,"When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus."
BIO,The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA.
BIO,"They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth."
BIO,Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.
BIO,The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid.
BIO,"There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce."
COMP,Ransomware and phishing scam alerts appear as press releases on the Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard.
COMP,"In 1972, Veith Risak directly building on von Neumann's work on self-replication, published his article 'Self-reproducing automata with minimal information exchange'."
COMP,Many computer viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows.
COMP,Most modern antivirus programs try to find virus-patterns inside ordinary programs by scanning them for so-called virus signatures.
COMP,"Bulletin board–driven software sharing contributed directly to the spread of Trojan horse programs, and viruses were written to infect popularly traded software."
COMP,"This method can detect new viruses for which antivirus security firms have yet to define a 'signature', but it also gives rise to more false positives than using signatures."
COMP,"Email viruses are viruses that intentionally, rather than accidentally, use the email system to spread."
COMP,"A well-written polymorphic virus therefore has no parts which remain identical between infections, making it very difficult to detect directly using 'signatures'."
COMP,Computer viruses generally require a host program.
COMP,"The disadvantage of this detection method is that users are only protected from viruses that are detected by signatures in their most recent virus definition update, and not protected from new viruses (see 'zero-day attack')."
COMP,They accomplish this by overwriting unused areas of executable files.
COMP,"Because those files have many empty gaps, the virus, which was 1 KB in length, did not add to the size of the file."
COMP,"Damage is due to causing system failure, corrupting data, wasting computer resources, increasing maintenance costs or stealing personal information."
COMP,Backups on removable media must be carefully inspected before restoration.
COMP,This is called cryptovirology.

COMP,"Many common applications, such as Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word, allow macro programs to be embedded in documents or emails, so that the programs may be run automatically when the document is opened."
COMP,"In a 2015 experiment, researchers at the University of Michigan found that 45–98 percent of users would plug in a flash drive of unknown origin."
COMP,Examples of such machine code do not appear to be distributed in CPU reference materials.
COMP,"The virus will eventually be activated by the ""trigger"" which states which event will execute the virus."
COMP,"It can be destructive such as deleting files on disk, crashing the system, or corrupting files or relatively harmless such as popping up humorous or political messages on screen."
COMP,In his work Kraus postulated that computer programs can behave in a way similar to biological viruses.
COMP,Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by other computers.
COMP,"Security software may also use a database of file 'hashes' for Windows OS files, so the security software can identify altered files, and request Windows installation media to replace them with authentic versions."
COMP,AV scans your computer and compares each and every file against a database of known viruses that functions a lot like a criminal database.
COMP,"Android and iOS are susceptible to various forms of malware, too."
COMP,"One manner of classifying viruses is to analyze whether they reside in binary executables (such as .EXE or .COM files), data files (such as Microsoft Word documents or PDF files), or in the boot sector of the host's hard drive (or some combination of all of these)."
COMP,Some viruses employ techniques that make detection by means of signatures difficult but probably not impossible.
COMP,"While a computer virus is a type of malware, not all malware are computer viruses."
COMP,Computer viruses infect a variety of different subsystems on their host computers and software.
COMP,"In addition, only a small fraction of known viruses actually cause real incidents, primarily because many viruses remain below the theoretical epidemic threshold."
COMP,"Some viruses are harmless, others may damage data files, and some may destroy files."
COMP,"This condition may be a particular date, time, presence of another program, size on disk exceeding a threshold, or opening a specific file."
COMP,They generally target a specific type of email system
COMP,"As the developers of anti-virus software compete partly based on how quickly they react to the new threat, they usually study and name the viruses independently."
COMP,Trojan horses can be included in software that you download for free or as attachments in email messages.
COMP,"The first IBM PC compatible virus in the ""wild"" was a boot sector virus dubbed"
COMP,"In 1982, a program called 'Elk Cloner' was the first personal computer virus to appear 'in the wild'—that is, outside the single computer or computer lab where it was created."
COMP,"Each infected program will now contain a clone of the virus, which will itself enter a propagation phase."
COMP,"The first one to appear on the Amiga was a boot sector virus called SCA virus, which was detected in November 1987."
COMP,"Other commonly used preventive measures include timely operating system updates, software updates, careful Internet browsing (avoiding shady websites), and installation of only trusted software."
COMP,"Restore points from previous days should work, provided the virus is not designed to corrupt the restore files and does not exist in previous restore points."
COMP,"Given a choice between traditional AV with limited threat detection technology and modern anti-malware with all the bells and whistles, invest in anti-malware and rest easy at night."
COMP,Stability test applications are similar programs which have the same effect as power viruses (high CPU usage) but stay under the user's control.
COMP,"Many Windows users are running the same set of applications, enabling viruses to rapidly spread among Microsoft Windows systems by targeting the same exploits on large numbers of hosts."
COMP,"Along the way, a name is attached to the virus."
COMP,"An old but compact way will be the use of arithmetic operation like addition or subtraction and the use of logical conditions such as XORing, where each byte in a virus is with a constant so that the exclusive-or operation had only to be repeated for decryption."
COMP,"(c)Brain, created in 1986 and was released in 1987 by Amjad Farooq Alvi and Basit Farooq Alvi in Lahore, Pakistan, reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written."
COMP,This is one of the reasons that it is dangerous to open unexpected or suspicious attachments in e-mails.
COMP,"Viruses used to be spread when people shared floppy disks and other portable media, now viruses are primarily spread through email messages."
COMP,"Malwarebytes’ Multi-Vector Protection, conversely, combines several forms of threat detection technology into one malware crushing machine."
COMP,The original hard drive can then be reformatted and the OS and all programs installed from original media.
COMP,"Restoring an earlier 'clean' (virus-free) copy of the entire partition from a cloned disk, a disk image, or a backup copy is one solution—restoring an earlier backup disk 'image' is relatively simple to do, usually removes any malware, and may be faster than 'disinfecting' the computer—or reinstalling and reconfiguring the operating system and programs from scratch, as described below, then restoring user preferences."
COMP,"A computer virus generally contains three parts: the infection mechanism, which finds and infects new files, the payload, which is the malicious code to execute, and the trigger, which determines when to activate the payload."
COMP,"While virus infected files may be accidentally sent as email attachments, email viruses are aware of email system functions."
COMP,"Virus phases is the life cycle of the computer virus, described by using an analogy to biology."
COMP,The compilation of a unified list of computer viruses is made difficult because of naming.
COMP,"The first virus to specifically target Microsoft Windows, WinVir was discovered in April 1992, two years after the release of Windows 3.0."
COMP,This will protect your system by checking for viruses each time you run an executable file.
COMP,The program rapidly spreads exponentially through susceptible computers and can only be countered by a second program called VACCINE.
COMP,"When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage."
COMP,The safest way to view email messages is in plain text.
COMP,"To avoid being detected by emulation, some viruses rewrite themselves completely each time they are to infect new executables."
COMP,"The drives may be left in a parking lot of a government building or other target, with the hopes that curious users will insert the drive into a computer."
COMP,"To which the replies are stated: 'Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease' and, 'I must confess I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery.'"
COMP,Shareware and bootleg software were equally common vectors for viruses on BBSs.
COMP,"Once the system has been restored, precautions must be taken to avoid reinfection from any restored executable files."
COMP,"In 1984, Fred Cohen from the University of Southern California wrote his paper 'omputer Viruses – Theory and Experiments'."
COMP,Different micro-architectures typically require different machine code to hit their maximum power.
COMP,"For instance, you could receive an email with a malicious attachment, open the file unknowingly, and then the computer virus runs on your computer."
COMP,Personal computers of the era would attempt to boot first from a floppy if one had been left in the drive.
COMP,Use a virus scan before you open any new programs or files that may contain executable code.
COMP,"Although most of these viruses did not have the ability to send infected email messages, those viruses which did take advantage of the Microsoft Outlook Component Object Model (COM) interface."
COMP,"The term computer virus, coined by Fred Cohen in 1985, is a misnomer."
COMP,"Microsoft offers an optional free antivirus utility called Microsoft Security Essentials, a Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool that is updated as part of the regular Windows update regime, and an older optional anti-malware (malware removal) tool Windows Defender that has been upgraded to an antivirus product in Windows 8."
COMP,The article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a SIEMENS 4004/35 computer system.
COMP,"Some viruses spread by infecting programs stored on these disks, while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector, ensuring that they would be run when the user booted the computer from the disk, usually inadvertently."
COMP,"In 1989 The ADAPSO Software Industry Division published Dealing With Electronic Vandalism, in which they followed the risk of data loss by 'the added risk of losing customer confidence.'"
COMP,"On its 50th use the Elk Cloner virus would be activated, infecting the personal computer and displaying a short poem beginning 'Elk Cloner: The program with a personality.'"
COMP,"Most security software relies on virus signatures, or they employ heuristics."
COMP,"They are still a harmful type of malware, but they are not the only type of threat out there today, on your computer or mobile device."
COMP,"The triggering phase can be caused by a variety of system events, including a count of the number of times that this copy of the virus has made copies of itself."
COMP,Computer viruses don’t typically capture headlines like that—at least not anymore.
COMP,Antivirus software also needs to be regularly updated to recognize the latest threats.
COMP,"Worms often spread from computer to computer and take up valuable memory and network bandwidth, which can cause a computer to stop responding."
COMP,Viruses use complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software.
COMP,"Regarding email attachments and embedded links, even if the sender is someone you know: viruses have been known to hijack Outlook contact lists on infected computers and send virus laden attachments to friends, family and coworkers, the Melissa virus being a perfect example."
COMP,"Since these would be symmetric keys, stored on the infected host, it is entirely possible to decrypt the final virus, but this is probably not required, since self-modifying code is such a rarity that finding some may be reason enough for virus scanners to at least 'flag' the file as suspicious."
COMP,This life cycle can be divided into four phases:
COMP,"In 1980, Jürgen Kraus wrote his Diplom thesis 'Self-reproduction of programs' at the University of Dortmund."
COMP,"Viruses may be installed on removable media, such as flash drives."
COMP,"One may reduce the damage done by viruses by making regular backups of data (and the operating systems) on different media, that are either kept unconnected to the system (most of the time, as in a hard drive), read-only or not accessible for other reasons, such as using different file systems."
COMP,"Viruses can’t spread without some sort of action from a user, like opening up an infected Word document."
COMP,This is because malicious hackers and other individuals are always creating new viruses.
COMP,"Bliss, however, requires that the user run it explicitly, and it can only infect programs that the user has the access to modify."
COMP,This makes it possible to create a file that is of a different type than it appears to the user.
COMP,"A computer virus is a type of malware that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code into those programs."
COMP,"This leaves antivirus software little alternative but to send a ""read"" request to Windows files that handle such requests."
COMP,The most common way of transmission of computer viruses in boot sector is physical media.
COMP,Most of these viruses are written in the scripting languages for Microsoft programs such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and spread throughout Microsoft Office by infecting documents and spreadsheets.
COMP,"Famously, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware worm spread around the world, took down thousands of Windows systems, and raked in an appreciable amount of untraceable Bitcoin ransom payments for the alleged North Korean attackers."
COMP,(it was also able to infect Windows 3.0 and Windows 9x hosts).
COMP,"In this case, the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus code."
COMP,"Resident viruses overwrite interrupt handling code or other functions, and when the operating system attempts to access the target file or disk sector, the virus code intercepts the request and redirects the control flow to the replication module, infecting the target."
COMP,"To avoid detection by users, some viruses employ different kinds of deception."
COMP,"If it looks like a virus and behaves like a virus, then it’s probably a virus."
COMP,"If you receive an attachment from a familiar email address, but were not expecting anything, you should contact the sender before opening the attachment."
COMP,"The first page of Dr Solomon's Virus Encyclopaedia explains the undesirability of viruses, even those that do nothing but reproduce."
COMP,"Antivirus software can detect it by decrypting the viruses using an emulator, or by statistical pattern analysis of the encrypted virus body."
COMP,"Some viruses try to avoid detection by killing the tasks associated with antivirus software before it can detect them (for example, Conficker)."
COMP,Security software can then be used to check the dormant operating system files.
COMP,"In response, an industry of antivirus software has cropped up, selling or freely distributing virus protection to users of various operating systems."
COMP,"We’ve made a distinction between computer viruses and malware, which now begs the question, “Do I need antivirus software or anti-malware software?”"
COMP,A Virus may also hide its presence using a rootkit by not showing itself on the list of system processes or by disguising itself within a trusted process.
COMP,"Some viruses, called polymorphic viruses, will employ a means of encryption inside an executable in which the virus is encrypted under certain events, such as the virus scanner being disabled for updates or the computer being rebooted."
COMP,"Also called the infection vector, this is how the virus spreads."
COMP,"The Bliss virus never became widespread, and remains chiefly a research curiosity."
COMP,"When a new virus appears, the rush begins to identify and understand it as well as develop appropriate counter-measures to stop its propagation."
COMP,"Any virus will by definition make unauthorised changes to a computer, which is undesirable even if no damage is done or intended."
COMP,"Some old viruses, especially on the DOS platform, make sure that the 'last modified' date of a host file stays the same when the file is infected by the virus."
COMP,"Selecting the option to view your email messages in plain text, not HTML, will also help you to avoid a virus."
COMP,"System Restore on Windows Me, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 can restore the registry and critical system files to a previous checkpoint."
COMP,"In older versions of Windows, file cryptographic hash functions of Windows OS files stored in Windows—to allow file integrity/authenticity to be checked—could be overwritten so that the System File Checker would report that altered system files are authentic, so using file hashes to scan for altered files would not always guarantee finding an infection."
COMP,"If a virus scanner finds such a pattern in a file, it will perform other checks to make sure that it has found the virus, and not merely a coincidental sequence in an innocent file, before it notifies the user that the file is infected."
COMP,Reinstalling the operating system is another approach to virus removal.
COMP,"Viruses and malware continue to evolve, and often cybercriminals use the type that gives them the best return at that particular time."
COMP,"Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks."
COMP,This includes packaged software that you buy from the store as well as any program you might download from the Internet.
COMP,Some viruses can infect files without increasing their sizes or damaging the files.
COMP,"A few years later, in February 1996, Australian hackers from the virus-writing crew VLAD created the Bizatch virus"
COMP,"Von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical 'father' of computer virology."
COMP,The virus writes its own code into the host program.
COMP,This can slow down productivity for regular workers.
COMP,Ransomware is a virus that posts a message on the user's screen saying that the screen or system will remain locked or unusable until a ransom payment is made.
COMP,A Trojan horse is a computer program that is hiding a virus or other potentially damaging program.
COMP,"This approach does not fool antivirus software, however, especially those which maintain and date cyclic redundancy checks on file changes."
COMP,"Secunia PSI is an example of software, free for personal use, that will check a PC for vulnerable out-of-date software, and attempt to update it."
COMP,"A simpler older approach did not use a key, where the encryption consisted only of operations with no parameters, like incrementing and decrementing, bitwise rotation, arithmetic negation, and logical NOT."
COMP,"The work of von Neumann was later published as the ""Theory of self-reproducing automata""."
COMP,"If a user attempts to launch an infected program, the virus' code may be executed simultaneously."
COMP,"Before computer networks became widespread, most viruses spread on removable media, particularly floppy disks."
COMP,Some websites—like Google subsidiary VirusTotal.com—allow users to upload one or more suspicious files to be scanned and checked by one or more antivirus programs in one operation.
COMP,"(automatic compression, for instance, is available under Windows at the choice of the user)."
COMP,"Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use)."
COMP,A simple call or text message can save you a lot of trouble.
COMP,A computer virus works in much the same way:
COMP,"Today, the “computer” in our pockets may be the one we use most often: our smartphones."
COMP,"An article that describes ""useful virus functionalities"" was published by J. B. Gunn under the title ""Use of virus functions to provide a virtual APL interpreter under user control"" in 1984."
COMP,"Examples of malicious activities include damaging files, theft of confidential information or spying on the infected system."
COMP,"This way, if data is lost through a virus, one can start again using the backup (which will hopefully be recent)."
COMP,The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows.
COMP,"Computer cooling apparatus are designed to dissipate power up to the thermal design power, rather than maximum power, and a power virus could cause the system to overheat if it does not have logic to stop the processor."
COMP,The German AV-TEST Institute publishes evaluations of antivirus software for Windows and Android.
COMP,"The advantage of using such slow polymorphic code is that it makes it more difficult for antivirus professionals and investigators to obtain representative samples of the virus, because ""bait"" files that are infected in one run will typically contain identical or similar samples of the virus."
COMP,"False positives can be disruptive, especially in a commercial environment, because it may lead to a company instructing staff not to use the company computer system until IT services have checked the system for viruses."
COMP,"In the 2010s, as computers and operating systems grow larger and more complex, old hiding techniques need to be updated or replaced."
COMP,"Payload activity is sometimes noticeable as it can cause the system to slow down or ""freeze""."
COMP,"Likewise, an operating system on a bootable CD can be used to start the computer if the installed operating systems become unusable."
COMP,"For example, the CIH virus, or Chernobyl Virus, infects Portable Executable files."
COMP,"Software development strategies that produce large numbers of ""bugs"" will generally also produce potential exploitable ""holes"" or ""entrances"" for the virus."
COMP,"Boot sector viruses specifically target the boot sector and/or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the host's hard disk drive, solid-state drive, or removable storage media (flash drives, floppy disks, etc.)."
COMP,A computer virus is a program that spreads by first infecting files or the system areas of a computer or network router's hard drive and then making copies of itself.
COMP,We’ve covered this topic before in great detail so checkout our article on antivirus vs. anti-malware.

COMP,This may cause permanent physical damage.
COMP,"While not opening attachments in e-mails from unknown persons or organizations can help to reduce the likelihood of contracting a virus, in some cases, the virus is designed so that the e-mail appears to be from a reputable organization (e.g., a major bank or credit card company)."
COMP,The interception can occur by code injection of the actual operating system files that would handle the read request.
COMP,"While some kinds of antivirus software employ various techniques to counter stealth mechanisms, once the infection occurs any recourse to 'clean' the system is unreliable."
COMP,Polymorphic code was the first technique that posed a serious threat to virus scanners.
COMP,Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus.
COMP,Creeper used the ARPANET to infect DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system.
COMP,Most users get viruses from opening and running unknown email attachments.
COMP,"As software is often designed with security features to prevent unauthorized use of system resources, many viruses must exploit and manipulate security bugs, which are security defects in a system or application software, to spread themselves and infect other computers."
COMP,"Microsoft's System File Checker (improved in Windows 7 and later) can be used to check for, and repair, corrupted system files."
COMP,"By contrast, a computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk."
COMP,"This will make it more likely that the detection by the virus scanner will be unreliable, and that some instances of the virus may be able to avoid detection."

COMP,"To enable polymorphic code, the virus has to have a polymorphic engine (also called 'mutating engine' or 'mutation engine') somewhere in its encrypted body."
COMP,"Viruses are harmful and can destroy data, slow down system resources, and log keystrokes."
COMP,"The first known description of a self-reproducing program in fiction is in the 1970 short story The Scarred Man by Gregory Benford which describes a computer program called VIRUS which, when installed on a computer with telephone modem dialing capability, randomly dials phone numbers until it hits a modem that is answered by another computer, and then attempts to program the answering computer with its own program, so that the second computer will also begin dialing random numbers, in search of yet another computer to program."

COMP,"Unlike Windows users, most Unix users do not log in as an administrator, or 'root user', except to install or configure software; as a result, even if a user ran the virus, it could not harm their operating system."
COMP,"In the Triggering phase a dormant virus moves into this phase when it is activated, and will now perform the function for which it was intended."
COMP,"“As it applies to cybersecurity, situational awareness is your first line of defense against cyberthreats. By staying on the lookout for phishing attacks and avoiding suspicious links and attachments, consumers can largely avoid most malware threats.”"

COMP,"A computer virus is a type of malware that attaches to another program (like a document), which can replicate and spread after a person first runs it on their system."
COMP,"In Microsoft Windows operating systems, the NTFS file system is proprietary."
COMP,"Also known as a logic bomb, this is the part of the virus that determines the condition for which the payload is activated."
COMP,"One method of evading signature detection is to use simple encryption to encipher (encode) the body of the virus, leaving only the encryption module and a static cryptographic key in cleartext which does not change from one infection to the next."
COMP,"Next, invest in good cybersecurity software."
COMP,"For now, though, here’s a quick gloss on the subject."
COMP,"Until floppy disks fell out of use, this was the most successful infection strategy and boot sector viruses were the most common in the 'wild' for many years."
