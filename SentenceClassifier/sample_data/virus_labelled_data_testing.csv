COMP,This difference has continued partly due to the widespread use of administrator accounts in contemporary versions like Windows XP.
COMP,"However, not all viruses carry a destructive 'payload' and attempt to hide themselves—the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs that modify other software without user consent by injecting themselves into the said programs, similar to a biological virus which replicates within living cells."
COMP,"When reading the VBR of the drive, the infected floppy disk or USB flash drive connected to the computer will transfer data, and then modify or replace the existing boot code."
COMP,"For example, an executable may be created and named 'picture.png.exe', in which the user sees only 'picture.png' and therefore assumes that this file is a digital image and most likely is safe, yet when opened, it runs the executable on the client machine."

COMP,"The Gammima virus, for example, propagates via removable flash drives."
COMP,"Cybercriminals aren’t creating new viruses all the time, instead they focus their efforts on more sophisticated and lucrative threats."
COMP,"In contrast, a non-memory-resident virus (or 'non-resident virus'), when executed, scans the disk for targets, infects them, and then exits (i.e. it does not remain in memory after it is done executing)."
COMP,"Users must update their software regularly to patch security vulnerabilities (""holes"")."
COMP,"Spinlock in a poorly written program may cause similar symptoms, if it lasts sufficiently long."

COMP,"As mentioned previously in this piece, traditional AV solutions rely on signature-based detection."
COMP,"A virus may also send a web address link as an instant message to all the contacts (e.g., friends and colleagues' e-mail addresses) stored on an infected machine."
COMP,Sometimes payloads are non-destructive and their main purpose is to spread a message to as many people as possible.
COMP,"In addition to scanning for viruses on a regular basis, install an 'on access' scanner (included in most anti-virus software packages) and configure it to start each time you start up your computer."
COMP,These viruses modify their code on each infection.
COMP,"This works by examining the content of the computer's memory (its Random Access Memory (RAM), and boot sectors) and the files stored on fixed or removable drives (hard drives, floppy drives, or USB flash drives), and comparing those files against a database of known virus 'signatures'."
COMP,"Another source of ambiguity in names is that sometimes a virus initially identified as a completely new virus is found to be a variation of an earlier known virus, in which cases, it is often renamed."
COMP,"in the Propagation phase the virus starts propagating, which is multiplying and replicating itself."
COMP,"It may be possible to recover copies of essential user data by booting from a live CD, or connecting the hard drive to another computer and booting from the second computer's operating system, taking great care not to infect that computer by executing any infected programs on the original drive."
